  <p> Hi, I am Ishant Singh. I like skateboarding, although I have been skating for about 8 months, I rarely do tricks.
    I also love math and science. I plan to do something between medical like a plastic surgeon or music related, but I
    know those 2 are really hard to do, and I feel like software engineering can be my backup. <br> <br>Hence, I'm here! I also like playing video games like fortnite and minecraft. Lastly, I want to study harder and innovate, and just work the hardest possible in general. Oh and i'm 17 years of age. </p>
  <!-- 5. After the third sentence in your bio, add a break tag. -->
